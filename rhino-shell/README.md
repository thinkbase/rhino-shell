rhino-shell
=================

The JavasSript shell runner based on [rhino-js-engine](https://github.com/thinkbase/dev-thinkbase.net/tree/master/rhino-js);
And use [r.js](https://github.com/jrburke/r.js) for [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) support.

This application has no build-in command line arguments, because it should load "/loader.js" as the start point,
 so you should put this file in your classpath then it should work.
